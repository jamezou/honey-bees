Like all pollinators, bees are important to the environment as they promote plant growth and reproduction. In particular, honey bee colonies managed by beekeepers across the United States play a crucial role in fueling the countryâ€™s food supply. Farmers and growers need honey bees to pollinate their crops to ensure better crop growth and yield.

However, honey bee colonies have declined over the years as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) poses a serious threat to their overall well-being and future. While a scientific cause has not been identified, several stressors that contribute to the downfall of colony numbers have been studied and recorded each quarter from 2015 to 2020.
